            <h1>ðŸš€ Tech|tonix Roadmap</h1>
            <p>
                At Tech|tonix, we are driven by a passion for open-source innovation.
                This roadmap outlines our goals and ideas for the future.
                While we cannot predict every challenge ahead, we hope to bring each of these projects to life step by step,
                always staying true to our values of simplicity, transparency and accessibility.
                Our journey has just begun, and we invite you to grow with us along the way.
            </p>

                <h2>1. Build the Website</h2>
                <p>
                    Our first milestone is to build and launch the <strong>Tech|tonix</strong> website as the central hub
                    for projects, downloads, documentation and community updates. The site will present our vision,
                    goals and progress with full transparency.

                <p>
                    Right after the website goes live, we will publish a <strong>technology blog</strong> to share tutorials,
                    development notes, open-source tips and news. The blog will also chronicle Tech|tonix releases and decisions.

                <h2>3. Create Office Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    We plan a suite of <strong>open-source productivity apps</strong> focused on speed and simplicity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lightweight editor for structured text (with live preview and export).</li>
                    <li>A presentation tool for clear, media-friendly slide decks.</li>
                    <li>A spreadsheet for calculations, data entry and small analytics.</li>
                    <li>A clean word-processing app for focused writing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every app will favor minimal UI, strong keyboard workflows, and portable file formats.

                <h2>4. Invent Our Own Markup Language</h2>
                <p>
                    We will design a new, lightweight <strong>markup language</strong> as an alternative to Markdown.
                    Our goals are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simpler syntax</strong>: fewer rules, fewer edge cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faster to type</strong>: minimal punctuation, optimized for keyboards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent rendering</strong>: predictable output across editors and exporters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This language will power our editor and integrate with our exporters (HTML/PDF and more).

                <h2>5. Desktop & Mobile Apps for Every Project</h2>
                <p>
                    For each project, we aim to provide <strong>desktop apps</strong> (Linux, Windows, macOS) and
                    <strong>mobile apps</strong> (Android & iOS) to make Tech|tonix tools accessible everywhere.
                    These applications will be built with modern frameworks such as <strong>Tauri</strong> and <strong>Ionic</strong>,
                    ensuring they remain <em>lightweight, fast, and resource-efficient</em>.
                    By focusing on performance and simplicity, our apps will offer a smoother experience and greater comfort for everyday use.

                <h2>6. 100% Open-Source Frameworks & Plugins</h2>
                <p>
                    Across all stages, we will rely exclusively on <strong>fully open-source frameworks, libraries and plugins</strong>.
                    This ensures transparency, auditability, community contributions and long-term sustainability.
