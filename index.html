            <p>Tech|tonix is more than just a website — it’s an <strong>Open Source hub</strong> where ideas become reality.
                Our goal is to design and share tools, apps, and experiments that empower people <strong>while respecting their freedom.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>In a world where privacy is often overlooked, we want to build a better future.
                Our mission is clear: <strong>to create tools that make life easier, safer, and more private</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>We chose our slogan — <em>Seismic Logic</em> — because we believe that nothing is stronger than logic.
                Logic has the power to shake foundations, to transform technology, and ultimately, to change <strong>everything</strong>!
            </p>

            <p>Step by step, we are building an independent ecosystem, a creative alternative to big tech platforms — with apps, utilities, and projects designed for everyone.
