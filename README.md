# Welcome to Tech|tonix!  
## Seismic Logic: Tech|tonix...

**Tech|tonix** is more than just a website ‚Äî it‚Äôs an **Open Source** hub where scripts become reality.  
Our goal is to design and share tools, apps, and experiments that empower people while respecting their freedom.  

In a world where privacy is often overlooked, we want to build a better future.  
Our mission is clear: **to create tools that make life easier, safer, and more private**.  

We chose our slogan ‚Äî *Seismic Logic* ‚Äî because we believe that nothing is stronger than logic.  
Logic has the power to shake foundations, to transform technology, and ultimately, **to change everything**.  

**Tech|tonix is just the beginning.**  
Step by step, we are building an independent ecosystem, a creative alternative to big tech platforms ‚Äî  
with apps, utilities, and projects designed for everyone.
